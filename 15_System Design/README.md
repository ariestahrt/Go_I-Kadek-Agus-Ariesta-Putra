# SUMMARY 

## 1. Diagram Design

**Diagram** is a symbolic representation of information using visualization techniques. (Wikipedia). Common diagram design tools are: SmartDraw, Lucidchart, Draw.io, Whimsical, Microsoft Visio.

Common used software design are: Flowchart, Use Case, ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram), HLA (High Level Architecture).


## 2. Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems:

1. Scalability
Scalabiliti is the capability of a system, process, or a network to grow and manage increased demand.
2. Reliability
Reliability is the probability a system will fail in a given period.
3. Availability
Availability is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period.
4. Efficiency
To understand how to measure the efficiency of a distributed system, let's assume we have an operation that runs in a distributed manner and delivers a set of items as result. Two standard measures of its efficiency are the responsse time and the throughput.
5. Serviceability or Manageability
Serviceability or Manageability is the simplicity and speed which a system can be repaired or maintained.

## 3. About Databases

### SQL vs. NoSQL
SQL and NoSQL (or relational databases and non-relational databases).
- Relational database are structured and have predefined schemas like phone books that store phone numbers and addresses.
- Non-relational databases are unstructured, and have a dynamic schema like file folders that hold everything from a person's address and phone number to theri Facebook 'likes' and online shopping preferences. 

### Database indexing
Indexing is  a way to optimize the performance of a database by minimizing the number of disk accesses required when a query is processed. It is a daata structure technique which is used to quickly locate and access the data in database. Most of the database using Binary-Tree as their data structure for indexiing and have complexity of O log n for search, delete, and insert operations.
